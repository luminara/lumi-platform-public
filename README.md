Luminara Blockchain is an Asset Tokenization Platform that enables its clients to create asset-backed, regulation-compliant, programmable securities on the Ethereum blockchain. Our clients use the platform to increase the profitability of your real world asset as well as raise financing for new projects.
 
 
 
__Luminara has been put on hold due to regulatory uncertainties__

We have invested several months building up and training a small but competent team with expertise in blockchain technology as well as legal and financial aspects, and despite the progress we made, ended up deciding to put the project on hold and pursue an amazing and ambitious insight we came to by building Luminara.


__We still love the blockchain__

Oh yeah baby.



__What's next__

As one of the first asset tokenization projects in Portugal, if not the first, we are proud of the path we have pioneered. We have learned a lot, and are leveraging that knowledge and experience to full use in our new project, [git//scale](https://www.github.com/gitscale), an economics platform for open source projects. It's a killer use case for algorithms, machine learning and the blockchain. Go check it out at [gitscale.io](http://gitscale.io).
